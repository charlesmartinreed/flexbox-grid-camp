### Flexbox

- CSS tool for laying out rows and columns
- "One dimensional"
- Good for navigation, image galleries
- Has wide browser support

## Flexbox - Containers & Items

- Some properties are for the container, others are for the items in the container
- These are often referred to as "parent" and "children" properties
- Items within a container are either **justified** along the x-axis (main) or **aligned** around the y-axis (cross)
- Generally, flex children will not exceed the bounds of their parent containers.

# Flexbox Parent Properties

- display (flex)
- flex-direction (row, col, row-reverse, column-reverse)
- justify-content (center, flex-start, flex-end, space-between, space-around, space-evenly...)
- align-items (flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline -- align items based on the baseline of the child items -- stretch)
